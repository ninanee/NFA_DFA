# NFA_DFA

1. This program takes as input a transition table for a DFA or NFA A, and outputs the transition diagram for A. For example, the input could be the automaton A = ({q0, q1, q2}, {0, 1}, δ, q0, {q2}) that has transition table and a transition diagram.
2. For question2, the Python program takes as input the transition table for an NFA A (no ε-transitions), such as the one above, and outputs the transition table and diagram for a DFA B, such that L(A) = L(B). For example, the NFA above should result in output
